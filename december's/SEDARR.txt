The special task force Sed managed to obtain a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,AN.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any element of the current sequence and replace it by any positive integer.
You need to make the sum of the elements of the sequence divisible by a given positive integer K. Find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to achieve this.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of operations.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤100
1≤K≤105
1≤Ai≤105 for each valid i
